Pokemon Crystal Legacy
====================

Introduction
------------
Pokemon Crystal Legacy is a ROM Hack by TheSmithPlays aiming to bring more in-game balance to Generation 2. This Showdown Mod ports over the changes made.

A comprehensive list of changes can be found [https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRAdTZtaRJHO2ipB2NxMuc8-_Zn0osMjaTJfKgvN5aN13_7DN80adr06EnLpy4v4EqQd_uTIQGBjjNM/pub](here).

It's a rather vanilla mod, making minimal changes, aiming to still feel like GSC rather than remaking the wheel. Chiefly, you're going to see:
- A few more useful moves, eg. Cut, Rock Smash, and Sky Attack.
- Stat buffs to weaker Pokemon, such as Arbok and Yanma. Notably, Entei has its Attack and Special Attack swapped.
- Occasional movepool buffs.
